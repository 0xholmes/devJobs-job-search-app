# devJobs-job-search-app

renderJobs() not working when I use the search function (searchJobs). So I create another function (showJobs) to solve the problem.

Everything seems to work, one problem occurs... I don't know how to show the number of jobs dynamically in the HTML <p>Showing <span id="job-number"></span> Jobs</p>
